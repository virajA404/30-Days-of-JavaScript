const paragraph = "My name is \\Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.\nI am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \
Node.js, Python, \tData Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \
In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \
to global audience and I started a \'Python\' challenge from November 20 - December 19.\
It was one of the most rewarding and inspiring experience.\
Now, we are in 2020. I am enjoying preparing the \"30DaysOfJavaScript\" challenge and \
I hope you are enjoying too."
